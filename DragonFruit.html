          Cutting a dragon fruit is a simple process, and here’s how to do it:
         <ol style="text-align: left;">
          <li><b>Choose a Ripe Dragon Fruit:</b> Pick a fruit with vibrant, evenly colored skin and a slight give when gently pressed, indicating ripeness.</li>
          <li><b>Wash and Prepare:</b> Rinse the fruit under cold water and scrub it gently. Use a knife to cut off the crown (the green spiky part) and the base, creating stable, flat ends.</li>
          <li><b>Cut in Half:</b> Make a lengthwise cut down the middle of the fruit, resulting in two equal halves.</li>
          <li><b>Scoop or Slice:</b> you can use a spoon to scoop out the flesh, however it’s best to slice it into bite-sized pieces and then peel the skin away from each piece.</li>
         </ol>
